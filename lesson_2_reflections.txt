//What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialising a repository creates the (hidden) file that git will use to keep track of changes.

//How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a transparent bridge between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to check on what is going on with your files before making a commit.

//How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git status to see what is in the staging area. If files with unrelated changes are in there, remove one before commiting.

//What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful with testing how a new feature might work. If you have two ideas for how something could be done, you could create two working versions of the project and compare them both.

//How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams help show where two branches separated, thereby showing which commits they share and which features and fixes will be the same (and which won't).
