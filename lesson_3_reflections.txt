//When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be good for working on a project from different places (and using difference computers) and collaborating on a project with others because the commits are universally available.

//Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Depending on the size of the project and your role in it, you may not need every single commit on your local directory. It would be more difficult to find the information you need (commits related to your role on a project, for example) using git log if every single commit were automatically pulled. Manually pulling puts the user back in control of what information is important to them.

//Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch can be thought of as a turn away from previous commits, which allows a person to "walk" (make changes to files) down two or more different paths simultaneously. "Walking" down one path does not affect the course of the other. A clone is copying a repository, including all of its branches, and recreating it somewhere else. This can be a clone of a repository in a local directory or a clone from a remote repository like those on GitHub. When cloning, there is no visible link from the clone to the original repository. A fork is similar to a clone in that it copies an entire repository including its branches. However, a fork is exclusive to when a repository is being copied from one user's GitHub account to another and it maintains a link to its original source.
